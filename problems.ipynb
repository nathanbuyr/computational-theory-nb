    "### Section 1.1 Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "The parity function is a simple bitwise operation that shows up in some cryptographic hash functions like SHA-1.\n",
    "It takes three 32-bit values (x, y, and z) and compares their bits one by one.\n",
    "For each bit position, it returns 1 if an odd number of the bits are 1 — and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, it’s checking whether the number of 1s across the three inputs is odd.\n",
    "That’s why it’s called a “parity” function — it’s about whether the bits have even or odd parity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In math form, it’s written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Parity}(x, y, z) = x \\oplus y \\oplus z\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ⊕ represents the **bitwise XOR** operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ⊕ symbol just means XOR (exclusive OR). XOR itself already behaves like a parity check:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you XOR two bits and both are the same (0⊕0 or 1⊕1), you get 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If they’re different (0⊕1 or 1⊕0), you get 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you extend that to three inputs, XOR effectively gives you 1 whenever an odd number of bits are set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hash functions, this kind of operation helps mix bits together — it’s good for diffusion, meaning that flipping even one input bit can completely change the output. It also adds a bit of non-linearity, which makes the function harder to reverse-engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m using NumPy’s 32-bit unsigned integer type (np.uint32) here so that it behaves more like a low-level operation, similar to how it would in C or in an actual hash algorithm implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation mirrors how the **Parity** function is defined in Section 4.1.1 in the Secure Hash Standard [(FIPS PUB 180-4)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)."

    "It works by taking the cube root of each of the first 64 prime numbers and using the fractional part of those roots to derive unique 32-bit constants.\n",

    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cube Root — For each prime p, calculate p ** (1/3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract Fractional Part — Remove the integer portion using math.floor().\n",

    "Bit Shift — Multiply the fractional part by 2^32 to shift it 32 bits left, isolating the upper bits for use as constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer Conversion — Convert the shifted value into an integer, then store it in the constants list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "This process generates the initial hash constants used in the SHA-256 compression function. These values appear “random” but are deterministically derived from mathematical operations on primes, ensuring both unpredictability and reproducibility.\n"

    "### Overview\n",
    "SHA-256 does not operate on an arbitrarily long message directly.\n",
    "Instead, the algorithm processes data in fixed-size 512-bit (64-byte) blocks, as defined in FIPS 180-4, Sections 5.1.1 and 5.2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because real messages almost never align perfectly to 512 bits, the SHA-256 specification requires a padding procedure to ensure that the message length is unambiguously encoded and the final block boundary is well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Padding the Message\n",
    "\n",
    "Real messages almost never have a length that is an exact multiple of 512 bits.\n",
    "To ensure that the SHA-256 block boundaries are unambiguous, the standard defines a precise padding scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Append a single 1 bit\n",
    "Represented as the byte 0x80.\n",
    "This guarantees that padding can never be confused with message data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Append enough 0 bits so that the message length becomes congruent to 448 mod 512.\n",
    "This ensures there is space for the final 64-bit length field.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Append the original message length (before padding) as a 64-bit big-endian integer.\n",
    "This prevents length-extension ambiguity and ensures collision-resistance in the [Merkle–Damgård](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction) structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Merkle Damgard diagram](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this step is always one or two complete 512-bit blocks.\n",

    "#### My Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I needed to handle the complete blocks that already exist in the message. I did this by iterating through the message in 64-byte chunks and yielding each one as I went. This part was straightforward since these blocks don't need any modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky part comes after all the complete blocks are yielded. At that point, there are some remaining bytes that don't form a complete 64-byte block, and this is where the SHA-256 padding rules come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing anything else, I stored the original message length in bits using `len(msg) * 8`. This is important because SHA-256 requires this value to be appended at the very end of the padded message as a 64-bit big-endian integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling the Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding process starts by appending a single `0x80` byte to whatever bytes are left over. This byte represents a '1' bit followed by seven '0' bits, and it marks the boundary between the actual message and the padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "After adding the `0x80` byte, I had to figure out how to handle the rest of the padding. This depends on how much space is left in the current block, which led me to consider two different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When There's Enough Space (56 bytes or less after adding 0x80)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the remainder plus the `0x80` byte totals 56 bytes or less, then I have enough room to fit everything in one block. In this case, I calculate how many zero bytes I need to reach exactly 56 bytes using `56 - len(padded)`, append those zeros, and then add the 8-byte length field. This brings the total to exactly 64 bytes, which is perfect for yielding as the final block.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When There Isn't Enough Space (more than 56 bytes after adding 0x80)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the padded remainder exceeds 56 bytes, I can't fit the 8-byte length field in the current block. So I had to split the padding across two blocks. First, I pad the current block out to a full 64 bytes by adding the necessary zeros, then yield it. After that, I create a brand new second block that consists of 56 zero bytes followed by the 8-byte length field, and yield that as the final block.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formalue and methods used\n",
    "\n",
    "- I used `isinstance()` at the start to validate that the input is actually bytes or bytearray, which prevents errors down the line\n",
    "- The `yield` keyword was essential for making this a generator, which means blocks are produced one at a time instead of building a huge list in memory\n",
    "- I used `.to_bytes(8, byteorder='big')` to convert the bit length into the proper 8-byte format that SHA-256 expects\n",
    "- Simple slicing with `msg[index:index + 64]` let me extract 64-byte chunks cleanly\n",
    "- Byte concatenation with the `+` operator made it easy to build up the padded blocks piece by piece"

    "\n",
    "The compression function operates in four distinct stages, as defined in FIPS 180-4, Section 6.2.2:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stage 1: Message Schedule Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Expands the 16-word (512-bit) input block into a 64-word (2048-bit) message schedule. This expansion ensures that every bit of the original message influences the hash state multiple times, creating the diffusion property that's critical for security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specification**:\n",
    "- **Words 0-15**: Taken directly from the 512-bit message block (16 words × 32 bits each)\n",
    "- **Words 16-63**: Generated recursively using the lowercase sigma functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The message schedule formula for words 16 through 63 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_t = \\sigma_1(W_{t-2}) + W_{t-7} + \\sigma_0(W_{t-15}) + W_{t-16} \\pmod{2^{32}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\sigma_0(x) = \\text{ROTR}^7(x) \\oplus \\text{ROTR}^{18}(x) \\oplus \\text{SHR}^3(x)$\n",
    "- $\\sigma_1(x) = \\text{ROTR}^{17}(x) \\oplus \\text{ROTR}^{19}(x) \\oplus \\text{SHR}^{10}(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stage 2: Initialize Working Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Load the current hash state into eight temporary working variables so they can be modified through the compression rounds without affecting the original state until the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specification**: The eight working variables $(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h)$ are initialized with the current hash values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = H_0, \\quad b = H_1, \\quad c = H_2, \\quad d = H_3$$\n",
    "$$e = H_4, \\quad f = H_5, \\quad g = H_6, \\quad h = H_7$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stage 3: Compression Loop (64 Rounds)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Mix the message schedule words and round constants into the working variables through 64 iterations. This creates the avalanche effect, where even a single-bit change in the input produces drastically different output, making it computationally infeasible to reverse the hash or find collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specification**: For each round $t$ from 0 to 63, compute two temporary values:\n",

    "- $\\text{Ch}(x, y, z) = (x \\land y) \\oplus (\\lnot x \\land z)$\n",

    "$$b = a$$\n",
    "$$a = T_1 + T_2 \\pmod{2^{32}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stage 4: Compute Intermediate Hash Value**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: After all 64 rounds complete, add the final working variable values back to the original hash state. This feed-forward mechanism ensures that the output depends on both the message block and all previous blocks, forming the Merkle–Damgård construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specification**: The new hash state is computed by adding each working variable to its corresponding original hash value:\n",

    "### My Approach: Dictionary Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "For cracking these passwords, I implemented a dictionary attack that tests a curated list of common passwords against the target hashes. The method works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Building a dictionary of likely passwords\n",
    "2. Hashing each candidate password using my SHA-256 implementation\n",
    "3. Comparing the computed hash against the target hashes\n",
    "4. Reporting matches as they're found\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach successfully cracked all three passwords, but it's important to acknowledge its limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Dictionary Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is fundamentally limited by the quality and size of the dictionary. If a password isn't in my list, the attack simply won't find it. Some key weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary dependency**: Only works if the password is in the wordlist or can be derived from simple variations\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: Even with a \"smart\" dictionary, testing millions of candidates takes time, we can see that the final hash took 1789 attempts but if it more complex it'd be considerably longer\n",
    "- **No guarantee**: Complex or truly random passwords will never be found this way\n",
    "- **Scalability issues**: Longer passwords or those with special character combinations exponentially increase the search space\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, attackers would use much larger dictionaries (millions of entries from leaked password databases) or combine dictionary attacks with brute-force methods, but the fundamental problem remains: if the password isn't predictable, a dictionary attack fails.\n",

    "## How to Defend Against This Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this attack worked so easily is that the passwords were hashed with **plain SHA-256** — no salt, no key stretching, nothing. Here's how to actually secure passwords:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Use Password-Specific Hashing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHA-256 should never be used for passwords.** Instead, use algorithms designed specifically for password storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Argon2id** (recommended by OWASP, winner of the Password Hashing Competition)\n",
    "- **bcrypt** (widely supported, battle-tested)\n",
    "- **scrypt** (memory-hard, resistant to hardware attacks)\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms are intentionally slow and resource-intensive, making brute-force attacks impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Add Salt (Unique Random Data Per Password)\n",
    "\n",
    "A salt is random data unique to each password that gets combined with the password before hashing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "hash(password + salt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it works**: Even if two users have the same password (\"cheese\"), their hashes will be completely different because each has a unique salt. This defeats rainbow tables and makes each password require individual cracking efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: The salt doesn't need to be secret — it's stored alongside the hash in the database. Its purpose is uniqueness, not secrecy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use Key Stretching (Multiple Iterations)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of hashing once, hash thousands or millions of times:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(100000):\n",
    "    hash = SHA256(hash)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it works**: If computing one hash takes 0.001ms, but you need 100,000 iterations, that's 100ms per password attempt. What used to take seconds now takes hours or days. Legitimate login attempts barely notice the delay, but attackers testing billions of passwords become computationally infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Argon2id and bcrypt do this automatically — you just specify the \"cost factor\" or number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Consider Using a Pepper (Secret Key)\n",
    "\n",
    "A pepper is a secret key stored separately from the database (like in environment variables or a key management system):\n",
    "```\n",
    "hash(password + salt + pepper)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it works**: Even if an attacker steals your entire database including all the salts, they still can't crack passwords without the pepper. This provides defense in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Argon2id\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what a proper implementation looks like conceptually:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# pseudocode for proper password hashing\n",
    "import argon2\n",
    "\n",
    "# when user creates password\n",
    "salt = generate_random_salt(16_bytes)\n",
    "hash = argon2.hash(\n",
    "    password=user_password,\n",
    "    salt=salt,\n",
    "    time_cost=3,        # number of iterations\n",
    "    memory_cost=65536,  # memory usage in KB\n",
    "    parallelism=4       # number of threads\n",
    ")\n",
    "store_in_database(hash, salt)\n",
    "\n",
    "# when user logs in\n",
    "stored_hash, stored_salt = retrieve_from_database(username)\n",
    "is_valid = argon2.verify(\n",
    "    password=user_provided_password,\n",
    "    hash=stored_hash,\n",
    "    salt=stored_salt\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Argon2id specifically**:\n",
    "- **Memory-hard**: Requires significant RAM, making GPU/ASIC attacks expensive\n",
    "- **Configurable**: Can adjust time/memory costs as hardware improves\n",
    "- **Side-channel resistant**: Protected against timing attacks\n",
    "- **Industry standard**: OWASP recommendation as of 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "My dictionary attack worked because these passwords were hashed with bare SHA-256, which is:\n",
    "- Fast (designed for data integrity, not password security)\n",
    "- Unsalted (identical passwords produce identical hashes)\n",
    "- Single-iteration (no computational cost to attackers)\n",
    "\n",
    "In production systems, use Argon2id with proper salting, and even weak passwords like \"cheese\" become extremely expensive to crack. The combination of unique salts + computational cost + memory requirements makes dictionary and brute-force attacks impractical, even with massive resources."
